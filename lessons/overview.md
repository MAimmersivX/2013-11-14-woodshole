# More About Software Carpentry

## History

* Founded by Greg Wilson in 1998, teaching scientists how to use supercomputers at LANL.
* Open sourced materials 2004-present
* Currently funded by the Sloan Foundation and the Mozilla Foundation

## What We Teach

* Unix Command Line Interface (Shell)
* Version Control
* Python
* Testing

## What We *Actually* Teach

* A program is just another piece of lab equipment
* Programming is a human activity
* Little pieces loosely joined
* Let the computer repeat it
* Paranoia makes us productive
* Better algorithms beat better hardware

*How to THINK like a programmer*

# Some High-Level Advice

## Be fluent in multiple languages
<comment>
You speak multiple languages when interacting with a computer.
Choosing to use a new tool, library, or language can be similar to
learning a new language:
</comment>

>
+ There is a high initial startup cost as you learn vocabulary, grammar, and
idioms
<font color=blue>`sum(x*y for x,y in itertools.izip(x_vector, y_vector))`
</font color>
+ You will learn faster by observing and working with others who are more
skilled than you
+ But once you have gained some fluency, you will find yourself capable of
new things!

## Use domain specific languages and libraries to increase your expressivity

* Aim for languages and tools that allow you to express your models and
manage your data simply. 

## Make it work right first, make it fast later.

## Use REPL Environments for Development

**REPL (read-eval-print-loop)** environments tighten the coupling between
the code you write and the results you see, increasing productivity.

REPL                                        non-REPL

Mathematica                  Fortran
LISP



# Don't Repeat Yourself (or Others)

## Automate common actions by saving simple blocks of code into **scripts**


* A script is a set of commands organized into a single file
* The script is the basest unit of scientific programming, you should be
comfortable writing these whenever you want to save or otherwise document or
repeat your actions
* Use scripts to explore new ideas, they are easy to write and throw away
* **Don't repeat commands into your REPL, save them to a script**

## Refactor commonly used blocks of code into **functions**

* Eventually, you will find that your scripts have a lot of repeated code,
or that you are spending a lot of time adjusting parameters at the top of
the file
* Refactor out repeated code into **function calls** in your scripts and
implement the **function** either in the same file or a separate one
* Be comfortable with the calling and return syntax of your programming language
environment, whether it is bash or Python
* **Don't repeat code in scripts, refactor them to functions**

## Group commonly used functions into **libraries**

* If you have to write a lot of software functions,
consider designing and releasing a library so that
others do not have to share your misfortune
* Check that nobody else has implemented the functionality you need
* If something close exists, it may be worth adapting to your needs if the
project is of high quality and suitably licensed
* *Openly licensed non-commercial libraries tend to have a much longer effective
lifespan than unreleased codes*
* **Share your code with others, and use their code**

# Reduce Complexity

## Basic strategies

* Use languages and libraries that reduce the complexity of
your work
* It is worth installing a complicated or expensive software tool if your
computations or model are naturally expressed with it
* Always look for opportunities to write **less** code
    + you will have to do less initial work (sometimes)
    + you will introduce less bugs
    + your code will be easier to understand and maintain
* When writing software, try to keep individual functions short, single-purpose,
and avoid excessive nesting

## Back up your data!

## Use version control for checkpointing and collaboration

* use local version control software to checkpoint personal code development
  + checkpointing your work encourages wild ideas and late-night coding sessions
  + you can easily restore back in the morning if it was a bad idea
* use **distributed version control** to collaborate with others
* We advocate *Git*, but you may be stuck with whatever your group uses
  + though check out git-svn for using Git to collaborate with an svn repository,
  it's awesome!

*We will learn more about working with git and GitHub today*

# Verify and Validate your Code

## Principles of verification and validation
* **verification** - is your code correctly written?
* **validation** - do your computations accurately model the physical phenomena
in question?
* test frameworks help you verify your code, but validation is usually a manual
process
* Be paranoid and test small things!  

# Document your Computational Work

## Principles of documentation
* Save every bit of code you use for generating publishable results
* Document and comment your code for yourself as if you will need to understand
it in 6 months
  + use README files liberally
  + as well as file-level, function-level, and inline documentation
* If any piece of code is too complex to easily describe, consider refactoring
it


## Schedule 

### Today

* **9:00-12:00** Managing and Collaborating with your Software, Data,
and Manuscripts with Git
* **1:00-4:30** Debugging, testing, and numpy/pandas


# Closing Thoughts

## Aim for reproducibility
* The goals of non-review scientific publications are to:
    + Describe a new result or approach
    + Convince others of its usefulness
* The **reproducibility** of your publication will greatly benefit both of
these goals
* See <http://figshare.com> for an easy way to store and share your data in
an easily-cited way
