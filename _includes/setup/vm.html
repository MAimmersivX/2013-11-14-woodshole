  <h3>Virtual Machine</h3>
  
  <p>
    While it is better for everyone to install tools in your 
    working environemnt, sometimes installation hits unexpected obstacles.
    So that you can continue to participate in a lesson even if one of your
    software programs fails, we provide a Linux virtual machine
    contains all the necessary software
    pre-installed. Please install
    <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>
    and download
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B4Kr6DYkzkQtd05FekRId05DLXM&export=download">this virtual machine image</a>.
    Load the VM into VirtualBox by doing Import Appliance and loading the <code>.ova</code> file.
    The ova file is 2Gbytes, and isn't anything special--it is just a linux
    environment in which git and python work that we have as a backup.
